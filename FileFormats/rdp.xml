	Interpreter for .rdp files
	
	Verified with Anno 1800.

	All positions are relative to <Center> and scaled by <Extents>.
	<FrameCount> is animation length.
	<FrameTime> is time in ms per frame.
	Texture speed is with <MovieFPS>=0 one cycle per longest particle frame count?
		Otherwise exactly what FPS means ;-)
